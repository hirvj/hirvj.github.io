My research and policy briefs have been featured in both international (The Economist, Wired) and Finnish (e.g. YLE, Helsingin Sanomat) media outlets. In addition, I've presented my work at multiple academic conferences, as well as at the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment in Finland.

You can find a list of my research also on my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.fi/citations?user=BWlNAqgAAAAJ&hl=en "Google Scholar").

Abstract: We present novel evidence on the impact of EU technology subsidies on employment and skill demand in Finnish SMEs, 1994–2018. The subsidies funded new machinery, including robots and CNC machines. Comparing closely matched grant winners and losers, we find that receiving a grant increased employment without changing skill composition. Using machine learning on application texts, we match firms by their evaluation reports, analyze their plans, and show that subsidies primarily supported expansion, such as launching new products, rather than automating work. In contrast, analysis of a broader sample of manufacturing firms outside the program reveals that IT investments are more strongly associated with skill upgrading than machinery investments, consistent with different technologies relating to skill demand differently. Our findings indicate that these grants created opportunities for non-college-educated workers.

<b>Business Development Grants in Disruptive Times</b><br>
(with Otto Kässi and Olli Ropponen)<br>
</p>

Abstract: We study the labor market impacts of Finland's initial COVID-19 subsidy program, aimed at mitigating the pandemic's economic fallout. Using a comprehensive and novel dataset, alongside a judge-leniency instrumental variables design, we analyze the effects of the subsidies on both firm and worker levels. Our results indicate that the program increased the wage sum and decreased unemployment risk in treated firms. However, it also led to a reduction in labor productivity, potentially impeding creative destruction. These findings underscore the need to consider potential productivity drawbacks when designing industrial policies during economic crises.
