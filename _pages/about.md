I am a PhD student at the [Department of Economics at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics "Aalto, Economics") & [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/members/johannes-hirvonen "Helsinki GSE") and an Affiliated Researcher at [Etla Economic Research](https://www.etla.fi/en/ "Etla Economic Research").

My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Labor Economics. More specifically, I am interested in how new technology affects firm competition and the labor market.
