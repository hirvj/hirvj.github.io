I am a PhD student at the [Department of Economics at Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en/department-of-economics "Aalto, Economics") and [Helsinki GSE](https://www.helsinkigse.fi/ "Helsinki GSE") and an Affiliated Researcher at Etla Economic Research.

My research interests are in Industrial Organization and Labor Economics. More specifically, I am interested in how new technology affects the labor market and firm competition.

You can find my CV [here](https://hirvj.github.io/files/CV-Hirvonen.pdf "CV").
