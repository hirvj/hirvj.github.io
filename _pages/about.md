I am an economics PhD student at [Northwestern University](https://economics.northwestern.edu/ "Northwestern Economics"). My research interests are in industrial organization and labor economics. A bit more specifically, I am interested in how new technology affects firm competition and the labor market.

You can find my CV [here](https://hirvj.github.io/files/CV-Hirvonen.pdf "CV").
